# About 3DGI

[3DGI](https://3dgi.nl) is a commercial spin-off of the world-leading [3D Geoinformation Research Group of TU Delft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl).
We maintain close ties with the group which enables us to access the embedded know-how and make it available to you.
Furthermore, 3DGI can provide continued support and development to make sure that the research results are well integrated in your product.
Our mission is to advance and facilitate the use of 3D geoinformation in daily practice.

You might already know the work of our hands as the [3D BAG](https://3dbag.nl), the [automated 3D building reconstruction software](https://github.com/geoflow3d/geoflow-bundle) or as co-editors of the [CityJSON standard](https://cityjson.org).
