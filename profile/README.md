# About 3DGI

[3DGI](https://3dgi.nl) is a commercial spin-off of the world-leading [3D Geoinformation Research Group of TU Delft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl).
After years of research and development work, we realized there is a need for accessibility and continuity beyond the scope of academic research projects.
We maintain close ties with the group which enables us to access the embedded know-how and make it available to you.
Furthermore, 3DGI can provide continued support and development to make sure that the research results are well integrated in your product.
Our mission is to advance and facilitate the use of 3D geoinformation in daily practice.
